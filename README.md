we make use of the embedded Watson AI libraries, to create an application that would perform sentiment analysis on a provided text. We then deploy the said application over the web using Flask framework.

Embeded libraries to create AI powered python application

Embeddable Watson AI libraries include the NLP library, the text-to-speech library and the speech-to-text library. 

The NLP library includes functions for sentiment analysis, emotion detection, text classification, language detection, etc. among others. The speech-to-text library contains functions that perform the transcription service and generates written text from spoken audio. The text-to-speech library generates natural sounding audio from written text. All available functions, in each of these libraries, calls pretrained AI models that are all available on the Cloud IDE servers, available to all users for free.

NLP sentiment analysis is the practice of using computers to recognize sentiment or emotion expressed in a text. Through NLP, sentiment analysis categorizes words as positive, negative or neutral.

Sentiment analysis is often performed on textual data to help businesses monitor brand and product sentiment in customer feedback, and understanding customer needs. It helps attain the attitude and mood of the wider public which can then help gather insightful information about the context.
